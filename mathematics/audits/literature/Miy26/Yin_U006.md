### Setting and reusable statements

Use the standard free circular normalization and the distinction between full `L2(M,tau)` and holomorphic `H2_c` in [Miy26-U005](Yin_U005.md#miy26-u005).
All coefficients are scalar, and `tau` is faithful and normal on the finite von Neumann algebra `M`.

For a positive integer `n>=1`, let

\[
f=\sum_{|w|=n}a_w c_w,\qquad
r=\|f\|_2=\left(\sum_{|w|=n}|a_w|^2\right)^{1/2}.
\]

Example 4.3 and Proposition 4.4 give

\[
\operatorname{spec}(f)=\operatorname{supp}\mu_f
=\{\lambda:|\lambda|\le r\},
\]

and `f` is R-diagonal.
The zero polynomial is included, with spectrum and Brown support `{0}`.
Degree zero is excluded: a nonzero scalar does not satisfy this centered-disk or R-diagonal conclusion.

For `k>=1`, a free circular family `c_1,...,c_k`, and real `t`, Example 4.5 concerns

\[
F_{k,t}=(1+tc_1)\cdots(1+tc_k).
\]

The formula valid at every complex `lambda` and every real `t` is

\[
\operatorname{spec}(F_{k,t})=
\left\{\lambda:\ |\lambda-1|^2
\le t^2 S_k(|\lambda|^{2/k})\right\},
\qquad S_k(b)=\sum_{j=0}^{k-1}b^j.
\tag{3}
\]

The Brown-measure support is the same set, with the source-proof boundary and the existing reviewed local support distinguished [below](#brown-support-for-the-product-and-retained-interface).
Formula (3) replaces the source's quotient at `|lambda|=1` by its continuous value and avoids its intermediate divisions by `t`.

### Homogeneous coefficient calculation and sufficiency

If `(lambda-f)^(-1)` is square-integrable, U005 puts its vector in the positive-word subspace.
The vacuum coefficient equation is `lambda alpha_empty=1`, so `lambda!=0`.
The remaining equations uniquely determine

\[
\alpha_w=0\quad(n\nmid |w|),\qquad
\alpha_{w_1\cdots w_j}
=\lambda^{-j-1}a_{w_1}\cdots a_{w_j}
\quad(|w_1|=\cdots=|w_j|=n).
\]

Unique segmentation into blocks of length `n` is essential here.
Consequently

\[
\sum_w|\alpha_w|^2
=|\lambda|^{-2}\sum_{j\ge0}(r/|\lambda|)^{2j}.
\]

Necessity gives `|lambda|>r`.
For the converse, when this inequality holds, the displayed coefficients define `X in H2_c`; multiplication by the bounded polynomial gives `(lambda-f)X=1` by the coefficient recursion.
The finite-algebra inverse argument in U005 identifies `X` as the affiliated inverse, and Corollary 1.2 makes it bounded.
This explicitly closes the sufficiency direction that is compressed into the source's phrase “if and only if.”
The point `lambda=0` is never a resolvent point, by the same vacuum equation.
For `r=0`, all nonzero `lambda` work.

### R-diagonality and the Brown inner radius

The source invokes the cumulant product formula and the powers argument in [NS06](https://rolandspeicher.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/nica-speicher-book.pdf), Theorem 11.12 and Proposition 15.22, printed pp. 180 and 253-254.
The exact product-formula statement and the mixed-cumulant theorem (Theorem 11.16, p. 183) were checked directly and accepted for this scalar tracial setting; their complete proofs are not independently re-audited.
Proposition 15.22's relevant combinatorial proof was directly inspected.

Here is the precise adaptation.
Multilinearity expands a cumulant in `f,f*` into words of the same length `n`.
The product formula sums over noncrossing partitions whose join with those consecutive length-`n` blocks is connected.
A surviving block cumulant must have one variable label and alternating adjoint signs, by freeness and R-diagonality of the circular family.
The color-independent connectivity argument of Proposition 15.22 then excludes adjacent equal signs of the outer blocks: the block meeting their boundary either starts there or has a preceding opposite sign, and in either case balance and noncrossingness isolate an interval of complete length-`n` blocks.
Odd outer length is excluded by sign balance.
Thus only alternating even cumulants survive.
This checks the source's multilinear extension; its accidentally displayed `f^n,f^n` should be `f,f` at that step.

The same argument establishes the source's R-diagonality remark for homogeneous polynomials in any star-free R-diagonal tuple.
It does **not** extend the circular coefficient norm or centered-disk formulas to that broader tuple.

R-diagonality alone does not prove a zero Brown inner radius.
For this `f`, if an affiliated inverse belonged to `L2`, U005 applied at `lambda=0` would make it holomorphic; `-f X=1` would then contradict the vacuum coefficient.
Hence `||f^(-1)||_2=infinity`, with the usual infinite value if there is a kernel.
The retained Haagerup-Larsen support theorem in U004 gives inner radius zero and outer radius `||f||_2`.
The nonzero constant-modulus exceptional case would make `f` invertible and is ruled out by `0 in spec(f)`; `f=0` is handled directly.
Therefore the Brown support is the disk already found for the spectrum.
There is no appeal here to an unproved general equality of spectrum and Brown support.

### Product coefficients and the transfer matrix

Assume first `lambda!=1`.
Every nonempty word `w` over `{1,...,k}` has a unique decomposition into maximal strictly increasing consecutive runs.
Let `N=|w|` and let `m` be the number of runs.
Equivalently `N-m` is the number of ascents `w_j<w_(j+1)`, with `1<=j<N`.
Expanding the product and comparing coefficients yields

\[
\alpha_\varnothing=(\lambda-1)^{-1},\qquad
\alpha_w=\frac{t^N\lambda^{N-m}}{(\lambda-1)^{N+1}}.
\tag{4}
\]

Indeed, for a maximal initial run of length `h`, the coefficient equation sums over all possible nonempty increasing prefixes.
Iterating it amounts to the compositions of `h`; their sum is

\[
t^h\sum_{j=1}^{h}\binom{h-1}{j-1}(\lambda-1)^{-j}
=t^h\lambda^{h-1}(\lambda-1)^{-h}.
\]

Multiplying these run factors proves (4), including `lambda=0` with the polynomial convention `0^0=1`.
The source's count of ascents should stop at `N-1`, since there is no `(N+1)`st letter.

Set `a_N=sum_(|w|=N)|alpha_w|^2`, `a=|lambda|^2`, and

\[
M(a)_{ij}=\begin{cases}a,&i<j,\\1,&i\ge j.\end{cases}
\]

The row index is the earlier letter, so an increasing transition carries the weight `a`; reversing this convention transposes the matrix and must be done consistently.
Direct word summation gives, for `N>=1`,

\[
a_N=\frac{t^2}{|\lambda-1|^4}\,
\mathbf1^T\left(\frac{t^2 M(a)}{|\lambda-1|^2}\right)^{N-1}\mathbf1.
\tag{5}
\]

All entries and both boundary vectors are nonnegative.
For `t!=0` and `lambda!=0,1`, positivity makes the Perron mode visible in this scalar expression.
Thus `a_N->0` and `sum_N a_N<infinity` are equivalent here, and both hold precisely when `t^2 rho(M(a))<|lambda-1|^2`.
This equivalence is justified by the positive finite recurrence, not by a general claim that scalar coefficients of every recurrence must detect its largest eigenvalue.

At `lambda=0`, `M(0)` is lower triangular with every diagonal entry one, and

\[
\mathbf1^T M(0)^j\mathbf1=\binom{j+k}{k-1}.
\]

Hence (5) is summable exactly when `t^2<1`; it fails to tend to zero at equality.
At `t=0`, the product is the identity and is treated directly.
At `lambda=1`, the vacuum coefficient equation has no solution, so this point belongs to the spectrum for every `t`.

### Perron eigenvalue, removable singularities, and boundaries

For `a!=1`, the source's characteristic polynomial is

\[
\det(xI-M(a))=\frac{(x-1+a)^k-a x^k}{1-a}.
\]

Subtracting successive rows of the eigenvector equations gives `x(v_i-v_(i+1))=(a-1)v_(i+1)`, from which this polynomial and its eigenvalues follow.
The quotient requires continuation at `a=1`, where `M(1)` is the all-ones matrix and the characteristic polynomial is `x^(k-1)(x-k)`.

A simpler nonsingular derivation of the eigenvalue needed for (5) works for every `a>=0`: put `b=a^(1/k)`, `rho=S_k(b)`, and `v_i=b^(k-i)`.
Direct substitution yields `M(a)v=rho v`.
For `a>0`, this vector is strictly positive, so positivity (or the weighted maximum norm) proves that `rho` is the spectral radius.
For `a=0`, triangularity gives `rho=1`.
Thus

\[
\rho(M(|\lambda|^2))=S_k(|\lambda|^{2/k})
\]

also at `|lambda|=1`, where its value is `k`.
Combining this with (5), the explicit boundary cases, and the same `AX=1` sufficiency argument used above proves (3).

Useful exact checks are: `k=1` gives the disk `|lambda-1|<=|t|`; `t=0` gives `{1}`; `0` belongs to the spectrum exactly when `|t|>=1`; on the unit circle (3) reads `|lambda-1|^2<=k*t^2`.
These checks include the parameters excluded by the printed intermediate divisions.
The original quotient `(|lambda|^(2/k)-1)/(|lambda|^2-1)` has the value `1/k` on that circle, not zero or infinity.

### Brown support for the product and retained interface

The primary interface checked by the external-input agent on 2026-09-08 is [DHH+25](https://arxiv.org/html/2510.10712v1) (cited as DHH+25 in Miy26), Theorems 1.25 and 1.27-1.28, in [U004](Yin_U004.md#miy26-u004-dhh-support).
Theorem 1.27 asserts support equality.
The later selected proof inspection retained in [DHH+25-U001](../DHH+25/Yin_U001.md#a-second-issue-the-detailed-proof-only-supplies-containment) found that Proposition 6.4(6), Theorem 6.7 and the cited BZ22 v2 Theorem 3.6 prove only containment in the closure of the strict domain; no general density-nonvanishing proof was found in that checked chain.

For `k>=2` and `t!=0`, use `u_0=1` and `t_DHH=k*t^2`, so every circular increment is multiplied by `sqrt(t_DHH/k)=|t|`.
For negative `t`, simultaneous multiplication of the circular family by `-1` preserves its joint star-distribution and hence its Brown measure and spectrum.

For the circular input, the inverse-square integrability parameter is infinite and the theorem's possible excluded inner disk is empty.
Its threshold function is `k*|lambda-1|^2/S_k(|lambda|^(2/k))`.
The reverse inclusion is the existing [C_F0094 proof version 2 density repair](../../../claims/Yin_C_F0094_v1.md#yin_c_f0094-density-repair), whose [selected isolated whole-proof review](../../reviews/Yin_R_F0105_v1.md#fresh-c43-whole) covers this normal-source calculation and its boundary cases.
Indeed, each standard circular step is bounded, normalized and R-diagonal; the degree-one vacuum obstruction above gives its infinite inverse-square integral, and `t!=0` makes the scaled step nonzero.
The cyclic initial matrix is normal and non-scalar for `k>=2`.
The repair applies the checked BZ22 density formula to obtain strict positivity on the open subordination domain outside its finite exceptional set, which does not change the closure; the block power-pushforward then gives the reverse support inclusion in the calculated product region.
This is the local project contribution supplying equality beyond the inspected external containment.
C_F0094's Brown-support argument uses the elementary closure conversion below; its later spectral comparison uses the independent spectrum calculation (3).
Neither use depends on the Brown-support equality recorded here.

For `k=1` and `t!=0`, the accepted HL00 interface in U004 and the standard circular step's zero inner radius give the disk `|lambda-1|<=|t|` directly by translation/scaling.
The general DHH+25 `k=1` statement has the separate [Haar-step applicability objection](../DHH+25/Yin_U001.md#a-restriction-revealed-by-an-endpoint-check) and is not used for this case.
For `t=0`, the distribution is `delta_1` and the support is checked directly; there is no nonempty strict domain or positive-density argument in that case.
U004 and DHH+25-U001 retain the actual versions, theorem hypotheses and different inspection depths; the 109-page original proof is not independently audited in this unit.

For completeness, the boundary conversion is local, not an assumption imported from that theorem.
Put `g(lambda)=|lambda-1|^2/S_k(|lambda|^(2/k))`.
For `t!=0`, every point on `g=t^2` is approached by points with smaller `g`: off the nonnegative real ray, rotate its argument toward zero at fixed modulus; at zero, move a small positive distance; on that ray, move the radius toward `1`.
The last assertion follows because `(r-1)^2/S_k(r^(2/k))` decreases for `0<r<1` and increases for `r>1`: writing the denominator as `D(r)`, one has `0<=D'(r)/D(r)<2/r`, so its logarithmic derivative has the required sign.
The point `1` has `g=0` and is not on this positive boundary.
Continuity then proves that the closure of the strict sublevel set is precisely (3).

That review checked the color-independent extension, zero Brown inner radius, product coefficients, transfer matrix, and degenerate parameters.
Its request to spell out the strict-to-weak sublevel closure was resolved by the explicit angular/radial argument above.
No unresolved gap was found in that scope; this is independent AI review.

These units support [Miy26 spectral source audit](readme.md#miy26-spectral-source-audit).
No general spectrum/Brown-support conjecture, arbitrary R-diagonal spectral extension, formal verification, or external human review is claimed.
